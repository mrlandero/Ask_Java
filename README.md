# Ask_Java
We will develop an app called Ask Java. The user can ask questions and Java needs to reply: true or false.

## Question 1.

```java
Me: Hi Java, do I have enough change to buy chips?
```

You have 3.50 in change, and the price of chips is 2.50. Replace the placeholder with an appropriate comparison.

```java
Java: " + ("<compare change and price>") + "\n
```

## Question 2.

```java
Me: Hi Java, can the elevator hold everyone?
```

There are **15** people, but the elevator can only hold **12**. Replace the placeholder with an appropriate comparison.

```java
"Java: " + ("<compare capacity and people>") + "\n"
```

## Question 3.

```java
Me: Hi Java, will my friend be happy?
```

Your friend wanted a PS5. But, you got them a toy car. Replace the placeholder with an appropriate comparison.

```java
"Java: " + ("<compare request and purchase>") + "\n"
```
